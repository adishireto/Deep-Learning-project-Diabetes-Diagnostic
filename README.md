# Deep-Learning-project-Diabetes-Diagnostic
Diabetes - This term includes people with problems with insulin, which is normally produced by the pancreas. 

Diabetes affects a person when there is a problem in the production of the hormone, which causes the level of sugar in the blood to rise. Diabetes is a serious disease affecting millions of people across the entire world. 

Thus, correct and timely prediction of this disease is very important due to the complications it can have in the case of other life-threatening diseases. The high blood sugar level is the primary cause mostly seen in this disease. 

Dataset Used: The dataset used for this project is Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset from Kaggle. This original dataset has been provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
